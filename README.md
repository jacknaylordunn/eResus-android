# eResus - Cardiac Arrest Clinical Scribe

A professional web application for documenting cardiac arrest resuscitation attempts in real-time. Built for healthcare professionals working in emergency and pre-hospital care settings.

## Features

- ⏱️ **Real-time Timer** - Track total arrest time and CPR cycle durations
- 📊 **Event Logging** - Automatic timestamping of all interventions
- 💉 **Drug Tracking** - Monitor adrenaline administration with interval reminders
- ⚡ **Shock Counter** - Track defibrillation attempts
- 🔄 **Rhythm Analysis** - Document shockable vs non-shockable rhythms
- 💾 **Cloud Sync** - Real-time synchronization across devices via Firebase
- 📱 **PWA Ready** - Install as a mobile app for offline functionality
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** - Optimized for low-light clinical environments

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore
- **PWA**: Service Worker with offline caching
- **State Management**: React hooks with Firebase real-time sync

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Firebase project (for cloud sync functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jacknaylordunn/eresus.git
   cd eresus
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```

   You can find these values in your Firebase Console:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project (or create a new one)
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll to "Your apps" and select the web app
   - Copy the config values

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Add project"
   - Follow the setup wizard

2. **Enable Firestore Database**
   - In your Firebase project, go to Firestore Database
   - Click "Create database"
   - Start in production mode
   - Choose a location close to your users

3. **Configure Firestore Rules**
   
   Use these authentication-scoped rules:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /artifacts/{artifact}/users/{userId}/arrestLogs/{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       match /arrestLogs/{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
       match /transfers/{transferId} {
         allow create: if request.auth != null;
         allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.expiresAt > request.time;
         allow delete: if request.auth != null;
       }
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if false;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Deployment

### Desktop
- Chrome/Edge: Look for the install icon in the address bar
- Click it to install as a desktop app

## Usage

### Starting an Arrest
1. Click "Start Arrest" to begin timing
2. The CPR cycle timer will automatically start

### During Resuscitation
- Click "Analyse Rhythm" when checking the monitor
- Select "Shockable" or "Non-Shockable" based on rhythm
- For shockable rhythms, click "Deliver Shock"
- Log drugs by clicking "Adrenaline" (tracks doses automatically)
- The app reminds you when adrenaline is due (every 4 minutes)

### Outcomes
- Click "ROSC" when return of spontaneous circulation is achieved
- Click "End Arrest" when resuscitation efforts cease
- All events are automatically timestamped and synced to the cloud

### Multi-Device Sync
- Each device has a unique ID stored locally
- All arrest data syncs in real-time via Firebase
- Review the same arrest log on multiple devices simultaneously
